## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests
similar movies based on movie metadata using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and
**Cosine Similarity**.

An interactive **Streamlit web application** allows users to type their
favorite movie and instantly receive recommendations.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)

- Movie metadata is converted into text features
- TF-IDF vectorization transforms text into numerical vectors
- Cosine similarity measures closeness between movies
- Top similar movies are recommended to the user
