CONTENT-BASED MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
========================================

This project implements a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System using
Machine Learning techniques and provides an interactive Streamlit web interface.


FILES USED IN THIS PROJECT
--------------------------
1. Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning with Python.ipynb
2. movies.csv
3. app.py
4. requirements.txt
5. movies.pkl
6. similarity.pkl


IMPORTANT NOTE (READ FIRST)
---------------------------
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the files:

- movies.pkl
- similarity.pkl

are not uploaded directly to GitHub.

All required project files (including the above two files) are available
in a single Google Drive folder.

Download all files from the Google Drive link and place them together
in one project directory before proceeding.

STEP 1: INSTALL PYTHON
---------------------
Ensure Python 3.10 is installed on your system.

Check using:
python --version

Recommended version:
Python 3.10.x


STEP 2: CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
-----------------------------------
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

For macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate


STEP 3: INSTALL REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
------------------------------------
Install all required libraries using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit


STEP 4: RUN THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK (OPTIONAL)
------------------------------------------
Open the notebook file:

Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning with Python.ipynb

Run all cells in order:
Kernel → Restart
Run → Run All

The notebook performs:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Cosine similarity computation

The notebook generates:
- movies.pkl
- similarity.pkl

(Note: These files are already provided via Google Drive and need not
be regenerated unless required.)


STEP 5: RUN THE STREAMLIT APPLICATION
------------------------------------
Make sure the virtual environment is activated.

Run the Streamlit app using:

streamlit run app.py

STEP 6: USE THE APPLICATION
---------------------------
1. Enter your favorite movie name in the input box.
2. Click the "Recommend" button.
3. The system displays a list of recommended movies based on similarity.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-------------------
This is a content-based recommendation system that suggests movies based
on similarity between movie metadata using TF-IDF Vectorization and
Cosine Similarity. The system does not require user ratings and works
purely on movie content.


TECHNOLOGIES USED
-----------------
- Python 3.10
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## ⚠️ Important Note About Large Files
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the following files are not uploaded
directly to this repository:

- movies.pkl
- similarity.pkl

All required files (including the above) are available via Google Drive.

🔗 **Google Drive Link:**
